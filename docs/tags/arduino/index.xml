      <description>Arduinode I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the Arduino Starter Kit projects recently, and I wanted to try a new project that was outside of the pre-made booklet. Working with an offline Arduino (intranet of things?) has let me learn a great deal, and I wanted to see how difficult it would be to connect my Arduino to a simple Node server, which would get me ready to connect it in any future projects.</description>

      <description>I worked through the third basic project in the Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book. I like to write about the projects to reinforce my own understanding.
The third project, the &amp;ldquo;Love-O-Meter&amp;rdquo;, creates a simple circuit with a temperature sensor. Using the Analog-to-Digital converter, the Arduino reads in the value coming from the temperature sensor, then lights up a combination of 3 LEDs depending on that value.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what my circuit looked like:</description>
