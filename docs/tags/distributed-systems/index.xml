      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been getting more interested in distributed systems, and I wanted to get experience building some of the concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve read about.
My interest lies more on the software and system design side &amp;ndash; more &amp;ldquo;how would we design and build an example of a distributed file system across four computers?&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;how do I make a reliable home server to play media?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; which is why my focus is on futzing around with some toy software problems instead of worrying about what a real production hardware setup would look like.</description>
