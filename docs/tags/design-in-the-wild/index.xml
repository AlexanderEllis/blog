      <title>Dark pattern for autoplaying videos: clickjacking pause</title>

      <description>I recently saw a common clickjacking dark pattern when trying to pause a video the other day.
On a Bloomberg news autoplaying video, the sound is initially muted.
Clicking anywhere on the video will unmute it. It would be pretty easy to have an invisible element overlaying the video that listens for a click, and it looks like that&#39;s probably what we have here: What&#39;s interesting is that the control panel (pause, play, scrubbing, etc.</description>

      <description>Junk mail is so interesting at its odd intersection between design, advertising, and psychology.
I usually try to pay attention to the ways that things around me are designed, and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been saving some junk letters that are particularly interesting in their attention-grabbing efforts. Here are a few of the notable envelopes I&amp;rsquo;ve received in the past few months.
 What if we didn&amp;rsquo;t put any information on it and made it look exotic?</description>

      <title>Good Design: Double Sided Park Signs</title>

      <description>I often walk my dog around a small reservoir near my apartment. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect distance for tiring a small terrier, and it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful area.
There are a number of signs around the reservoir that tell you to not swim in the water (as it&amp;rsquo;s a backup emergency water supply) and to not walk on the ice when it&amp;rsquo;s frozen over in the winter (as it&amp;rsquo;s very, very cold if you fall in).</description>

      <title>Letting the User Guide You: Analyzing Store Design</title>

      <description>I enjoy looking at design in everyday life and the balance between how things are designed and how people try to use them.
A store I visited recently had bad customer flow, and the signs were there. There was literally a sign telling customers where to line up for the checkout line. Customers didn&amp;rsquo;t naturally line up there, and an employee was correcting customers who missed the sign. This is bad design.</description>

      <description>I take the MBTA 86 bus as part of my commute in the morning. It runs from Reservoir in Brighton to Sullivan Station in Cambridge, and it stops at Harvard on the way, which is where I get off.
Right after the Eliot street stop, there are two ways for the bus to get underground to the Harvard stop. One way is to go down Bennett St., take a right on University Road, take a right on Mt.</description>
