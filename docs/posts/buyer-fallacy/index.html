                    <p>There&rsquo;s a trap I used to fall into that has happened more times than I&rsquo;d like to
admit<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The typical scenario would be something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a hobby I&rsquo;m into (or starting to get into)</li>
<li>I find myself wanting to do that hobby more than I currently am</li>
<li>I find some <code>THING</code> that seems like it would help</li>
<li>I somehow convince myself that having that <code>THING</code> would make the difference</li>
<li>I purchase that <code>THING</code></li>
<li>The <code>THING</code> only slightly helps, and I may or may not do the hobby more</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Much like the scroll in Kung Fu Panda, the secret was really inside myself the
whole time. But, as I mentioned, I&rsquo;ve fallen into this a few times before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had the perfect notebooks, I would write much more by hand&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If I had that drawing board, it would make it that much easier to practice
drawing and I would draw so much more&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing standing between me and painting is those new paint pens&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, the new shiny things were <em>not</em> the only things standing
between me and doing my hobbies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so tempting, though. Maybe that thing is what the pros use, and of course
it would make sense to upgrade my equipment if I want to get better (spoiler:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zezwd8mNOnE">it isn&rsquo;t the shoes</a>). Maybe I&rsquo;ve
been more tired and burnt out recently without the energy to sit down and do my
hobbies and I fool myself into thinking this new drawing board would make the
difference. Maybe it&rsquo;s only $40 and Amazon will deliver it tomorrow.</p>
<p>At some point I started to see the pattern, and I started fooling myself less
and less and built up defenses as I became more aware of it. I have a &ldquo;nice to
have&rdquo; shopping list I add to when I have that spur-of-the-moment feeling — if it
would really be helpful, it&rsquo;ll still be there in a month. I think about whether
I&rsquo;m fooling myself with this old pattern, and having fallen into the trap a few
times, I find it easier to take a moment to think about whether I&rsquo;m starting to
think like this. Even recognizing the pattern has helped me avoid it, like I&rsquo;ve
given it a name and can now point to it, as if it was a gremlin in the back of
my head whispering foolish thoughts.</p>
<p>Maybe the gremlin&rsquo;s name is Purchasa. No, Purchasa, the more expensive guitar
won&rsquo;t make me play more or play better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also accepted that I won&rsquo;t be 100% into all of my hobbies at the same time,
and it&rsquo;s OK if my interest in something ebbs in favor of other things. If I&rsquo;m
not pursuing <em>any</em> of my hobbies, there&rsquo;s probably something else going on that
I need to take a look at, but if it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve been playing more guitar
than piano recently, that&rsquo;s totally fine. There just isn&rsquo;t enough time for
everything.</p>
<p>For new hobbies, there are little gut checks that help as well, like &ldquo;try
without it for a month and see if you&rsquo;re still doing your new hobby, then
re-decide from there&rdquo;. Maybe we buy a single month pass at the climbing gym to
make sure we really like it before we buy the full year. Maybe the one-month
pass is a little more expensive, but it&rsquo;s like a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fool yourself&rdquo; fee that
frequently ends up more than worth it.</p>
<p>There are a few things that don&rsquo;t fall under this, though. You really do need a
skateboard to skateboard, though bonus points if you can borrow from a friend.
If you&rsquo;re going to be spending a lot of time in front of your computer for your
hobby, a good ergonomic setup is worth it. There are points at which an
equipment upgrade actually makes a real difference, but when I&rsquo;m honest with
myself, I&rsquo;m usually far from that point. Until we get there, let&rsquo;s stick with
what we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>I still need practice to get to Carnegie Hall, and buying that thing probably
won&rsquo;t be the difference.</p>
