                    <p>I often walk my dog around a small reservoir near my apartment.  It&rsquo;s a perfect distance for tiring a small terrier, and it&rsquo;s a beautiful area.</p>
<p>There are a number of signs around the reservoir that tell you to not swim in the water (as it&rsquo;s a backup emergency water supply) and to not walk on the ice when it&rsquo;s frozen over in the winter (as it&rsquo;s very, very cold if you fall in). These signs are switched for the appropriate season.</p>
<p>On one of my walks, I noticed that one of the signs was partially hidden by its support.</p>
<p><img src="back.JPG" alt="The top sign says &amp;ldquo;DANGER: Unsafe Ice Conditions,&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s mostly blocked by the post."></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I remembered having seen this sign displayed in the winter, but I didn&rsquo;t remember the post in front of it. Checking the reverse, I saw that the other side was the summer-time version: &ldquo;No Swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="front.JPG" alt="Front of the sign"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have two signs, each for roughly half of the year, where do you keep the other sign when it&rsquo;s not in use?  Here is a simple answer: on the back of the other one.  Switching the seasonal signs is as easy as removing it, reversing it, and bolting it back on.</p>
<p>Every sign to be swapped can be visited with just a handful of tools.  You don&rsquo;t have to worry about storing, bringing, counting, misplacing, or manufacturing the other signs.  It&rsquo;s the Mass Department of Conservation and Recreation, and they want to save the extra metal!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the cleanest looking solution, but it is simple and it works.  It seems like an obvious choice when you notice it, as good design should.</p>
