                    <p>Junk mail is so interesting at its odd intersection between design, advertising, and psychology.</p>
<p>I usually try to pay attention to the ways that things around me are designed, and recently I&rsquo;ve been saving some junk letters that are particularly interesting in their attention-grabbing efforts. Here are a few of the notable envelopes I&rsquo;ve received in the past few months.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-if-we-didnt-put-any-information-on-it-and-made-it-look-exotic">What if we didn&rsquo;t put any information on it and made it look exotic?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a letter I received with a colorful design and no information:</p>
<p><img src="air-mail-1.png" alt="Air mail">
<img src="air-mail-2.JPG" alt="Air mail two"></p>
<p>You can tell by the pixelation that it&rsquo;s all just printed on, and it&rsquo;s actually a request for donations for a company that provides loans (but not donations?) to farmers in Africa.</p>
<p>There are a few things that this design does.</p>
<p><em>No return address</em>: I don&rsquo;t immediately know it&rsquo;s junk from a non-profit, and it could be from someone I know. This could make me less likely to toss it immediately.
<br>
<em>Air mail stamps and old school border design</em>: makes it look more interesting than your usual mail, which adds to the allure. Best case scenario it was really routed through Brussels.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do-with-color">What can we do with color?</h2>
<p>Next up is a bright blue letter that stood out from its all-white neighbors.</p>
<p><img src="blueeeee.png" alt="Blue"></p>
<p><em>Bright blue color and embossed &ldquo;hello&rdquo;</em>: these catch your eye with color and texture.
<br>
<em>Pre-qualified</em>: classic.
<br>
<em>Lower case &ldquo;hello&rdquo;</em>: signaling that it&rsquo;s casual, not just corporate.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mailing-to-people-who-registered-dogs-in-cambridge">Mailing to people who registered dogs in Cambridge</h2>
<p>I got a political mailer that stood out to me. It&rsquo;s less about opening a letter, but it&rsquo;s still advertising.</p>
<p><img src="dog-mailer.JPG" alt="Dog Mailer"></p>
<p><em>Dog-focused</em>: they clearly know I have a dog, so they sent me the dog mailer.
<br>
<em>Photo with a dog</em>: Craig is clearly dog-friendly.
<br>
<em>Endorsed by Mass Voters for Animals and Sierra Club</em>: lots of positive signaling.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="save-a-child-and-get-a-map">Save a child <strong>and</strong> get a map</h2>
<p>This letter asks for your help and shows you a child that you could help. They also advertise a free gift, which is oddly a map of the United States.</p>
<p><img src="save-child.png" alt="Save Child">
<img src="save-child-and-get-map.JPG" alt="Save Child Get Map"></p>
<p><em>Personalized</em>: this is no &ldquo;To Whom It May Concern&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s <em>you</em> that can help, and they call that out.
<br>
<em>Showing you a child you can help</em>: this helps make the issue real, since you can directly see who you could help.
<br>
<em>Free map</em>: this one is pretty odd to include, but when you get a gift by just opening the letter, opening the letter becomes even more appealing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="action-required-for-your-electricity-account">Action required for your electricity account</h2>
<p>I have an account with Eversource, the utilities company that provides the electricity I&rsquo;m using to write this, and I received this letter from another company, which is importantly <em>not</em> Eversource.</p>
<p><img src="energy.png" alt="Energy">
<br></p>
<p><em>Attention Eversource Customer</em>
<br>
<em>Action Required by: 2019-11-30</em>: this vague notice about a required action is a ploy to get you to open the letter, since you&rsquo;d would want to know about any issue with your utilities immediately. The &ldquo;required&rdquo; action is actually just a deadline for a special rate to switch your electricity to be from clean energy. Important, but surely not required.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="offering-offers">Offering offers</h2>
<p>This one&rsquo;s a classic: offering a limited time bonus for signing up and displaying it prominently.</p>
<p><img src="limited-time-offer.png" alt="Limited Time Offer">
<img src="double-bonus-miles.JPG" alt="Double Bonus Miles"></p>
<p><em><del>30,000</del> 60,000</em>: Double the miles! Except it&rsquo;s a little unclear if the usual offer is 30,000. This is something you could easily just say, like raising a price before a &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.
<br>
<em>Limited time offer</em>: classic. Better act fast.
<br>
<em>Float Away/photo of pool/Implying &ldquo;This could be you.&rdquo;</em>: Yeah right, maybe if I looked good in a one-piece.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple-just-tell-me-to-look-inside">Keep it simple: just tell me to look inside</h2>
<p>SoFi keeps it simple and adds some text that could easily be taken straight from a clickbait article:</p>
<p><img src="look-inside.png" alt="Look Inside"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="slight-hyperbole">Slight hyperbole</h2>
<p><img src="most-important-catalog.JPG" alt="Most Important Catalog"></p>
<br>
Coming soon on FiveThirtyEight: Christmas catalog power rankings.
<hr>
<h2 id="discounts-and-visible-gift-cards">Discounts and visible gift cards</h2>
<p>I found this one interesting. It&rsquo;s pretty common to give a special deal for signing up, and this front is no different. What sets this apart is the back of the envelope; it&rsquo;s semi-translucent, and you can see the gift cards within.</p>
<p><img src="free-meals.png" alt="Free Meals">
<img src="visible-gift-cards.JPG" alt="Visible Gift Cards"></p>
<p><em>9 Free Meals including free shipping</em>: Classic free stuff, including free shipping.
<br>
<em>Take grocery shopping off your plate</em>: fun meal pun, fun meal company.
<br>
<em>Visible gift cards</em>: this gives an extra appeal of &ldquo;I can see those and I want them.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re physical gift cards, which makes the discounts feel even realer.</p>
<p>I wonder how much more expensive this is to make?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="notable-mentions-not-featured-here">Notable mentions not featured here</h2>
<p>There are a few that I&rsquo;ve gotten in the past but haven&rsquo;t saved since I thought of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mailing me a nickel and putting it in clear plastic so I can see it</li>
<li>Credit card offer that looks like a check (including the tearable sides like a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNRrjTlgv-0FYhRZsz9KaUpPwvA14Q%3A1571534689750&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=798&amp;ei=YberXYSYK8qm_Qb7go_YDA&amp;q=pressure+seal+check&amp;oq=pressure+seal+check&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39j0l2j0i24l2.898.2705..2835...0.0..0.154.1431.18j1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i131j0i8i30.P6LZIDeYEY4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEzLr31qnlAhVKU98KHXvBA8sQ4dUDCAY&amp;uact=5">pressure sealed check</a>)</li>
<li>Credit card offer that was just a manila envelope with no return information</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-the-point">What&rsquo;s the point?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll preface this by saying I have no familiarity with advertising by mail, so the following is all speculation.</p>
<p>In these examples, we can see a <em>huge</em> push just to get you to even open the letter.</p>
<p>I would imagine that there&rsquo;s a huge drop off in the recipient pipeline between receiving the letters and opening, then another big drop between opening and following through (signing up, sending donations, etc). There&rsquo;s no tracking pixel that will report back that I&rsquo;ve opened their letter, but I could see some A/B testing where they keep the contents the same and vary the envelope, or vice-versa, then see if the recipient was more or less likely to follow through.</p>
<p>In that lens, I could imagine these being ways to improve the open-rate, but at what cost? Like an ad click that doesn&rsquo;t end up in a sale, I could see some of these resulting in more open envelopes, but it feels like a race to the bottom. At least it gives us an interesting view into how they&rsquo;re designing these envelopes to be opened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes out for any interesting ones in the future. In the mean time, I&rsquo;ll be here enjoying my free gifts.</p>
