                    <p>There are things that are hard to measure, and there are things that are easy to measure. I think about this duality a
lot when it comes to software engineering, especially when it comes to the difficult task of measuring developer
productivity and engineer effectiveness<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Taking a very naive approach, there are many easily measurable aspects of the job that you <em>could</em> use<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jira tickets closed</li>
<li>Number of pull requests submitted (or reviewed)</li>
<li>Number of lines of code</li>
<li>Number of interviews given</li>
<li>Number of design documents written</li>
<li>Features shipped</li>
<li>Money coming in because of those features (if there&rsquo;s a direct connection)</li>
<li>Time engineer spends at the office</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>What about the parts of the job that are harder to measure?</p>
<ul>
<li>The quality of those PRs, PR reviews, lines of codes, or interviews</li>
<li>How well those features are built</li>
<li>Mentoring and helping other engineers grow</li>
<li>Giving technical talks and spreading knowledge</li>
<li>Reducing technical debt</li>
<li>Deciding to <em>not</em> build features (when appropriate)</li>
<li>The monetary value of engineering that&rsquo;s not directly connected to revenue</li>
<li>The knowledge accumulated by building an initial feature that you can use as a foundation for future work</li>
<li>Even just the value of two team members just sitting down for coffee</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Some of these can be correlated to things across the divide. If you&rsquo;re an effective engineer shipping new features, you
may write a fair bit of code. If you&rsquo;re able to effectively build consensus about solving a difficult problem with
cross team buy-in, you may end up writing a few design documents. If you&rsquo;re able to narrow down your team&rsquo;s focus to
just those features the team can (and should) build, you&rsquo;ll likely be able to better ship those features.</p>
<p>But, this positive relationship doesn&rsquo;t hold up in the other direction, and that&rsquo;s the danger. The number of
lines of code an engineer writes is not indicative of the value of that code — we&rsquo;re in the business of <em>elegant</em>
solutions to complex problems after all. You can&rsquo;t build consensus by sheer volume of documents and meetings alone,
unless you&rsquo;re hoping that the other party resigns out of fatigue by the time the decision has to be made. If you do a
bunch of interviews, is it valuable if you&rsquo;re a jerk in those interviews?</p>
<p>On the other hand, does the negative relationship hold up in the other direction? Well, it&rsquo;s nuanced. Maybe the project was
exploration-heavy, and that didn&rsquo;t translate to many PRs. Maybe it was a critical one line fix, but it took a month of
intensive investigation to find it. Or, maybe I really do have a second remote job,
and I&rsquo;ve been too busy with it this quarter to get to all of my Jira tickets<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to measure the full picture by just the easily measured metrics alone. Doing so ignores the real
depth of the job.</p>
<p>More so, if 1) you&rsquo;re just using the easy ones and 2) the way you evaluate is visible to the engineers under review<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>,
they&rsquo;re going to game it. How could they not? If they&rsquo;re being evaluated on the number of new features they ship and
this evaluation has a direct relationship to the money they receive or their career trajectory, of course they&rsquo;re going
to optimize their time and effort towards the new features. It&rsquo;s your fault for hiring a bunch of smart cookies!</p>
<hr>
<p>So how do you measure how effective an engineer is? This is where I&rsquo;m going to take the easy way out — that&rsquo;s well
beyond the scope of this short post, written by a lowly engineer. All that I ask is that if you&rsquo;re in the position where
you&rsquo;re evaluating engineers, you look beyond the easy-to-measure metrics, as there&rsquo;s so much more to the work. It&rsquo;s
hard, but this is the way.</p>
