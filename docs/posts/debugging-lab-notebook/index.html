                    <p>I like to keep a debugging lab notebook when I&rsquo;m working through a particularly tricky problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing fancy, just a new tab visit to <a href="https://docs.new"><code>docs.new</code></a> and a quick <code>@today</code> to add today&rsquo;s date. I usually try to describe the problem and the specific issue I&rsquo;m having, including any reproduction steps or screenshots (frequently copied over from the issue tracker). I try to summarize the issue and my understanding of how things work, though this frequently leads to a handful of open questions for me to go through to really understand what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>What usually follows is a freeform jumble of writing down hypotheses, results, error messages, screenshots, explanations, and log statements (something like <code>print('alex here 7.5')</code> is a classic, since if you add another log statement between existing ones, you can add another decimal place to show you&rsquo;re in between). I try to err on the side of including too much information so that I can shift everything out of my immediate working memory onto something a little more permanent, giving a clear history of what I&rsquo;ve attempted as I work through the problem, but also importantly, what open questions remain and what things I should attempt next.</p>
<hr>
<p>This helps me in two main ways. First, it encourages me to take a minute to explain in writing what I&rsquo;m seeing — if I can&rsquo;t explain it, I probably don&rsquo;t fully understand it. Much like rubber duck debugging, this makes me think it through and work through what&rsquo;s happening, which is frequently enough to help me realize an important insight.</p>
<p>The second main benefit ties into this as well, as the process of working through and writing things down encourages me to be more deliberate about the debugging path I take. It can be so tempting to just make a quick edit as a shot in the dark and rerun the test, and I&rsquo;ve definitely done this plenty of times before. I find that I&rsquo;m much more effective when I&rsquo;m more deliberate about things, taking the time to explore each result and the next potential steps before moving forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the joke about the best way a junior engineer can level up: actually reading the error messages!</p>
<p>Many of these benefits show up as well when you&rsquo;re pair programming or even just explaining the issue to your rubber duck (or curious pet). The other thing I like about this written approach is that it&rsquo;s saved for you. When you come back to it later, you can retrace your steps, copy the same saved output or rerun a test, and page the context back into your working memory. My brain works much better as a processing machine than as a storage device, and the more I can keep written down and off of my busy brain&rsquo;s responsibilities, the better.</p>
<hr>
<p>At some point, finally, the problem clicks, and you realize the key insight that helps you solve it. You write up a quick summary, update the issue, and throw a quick explanation into the PR. The working notebook, full of roundabout exploration and steps taken down many false paths, has done its job. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll look up how I solved a similar problem before or ran a test in a certain way, but generally, I rarely ever come back to them. For these debugging logs, that&rsquo;s ok; it&rsquo;s much more about how they&rsquo;ve helped with the journey through.</p>
