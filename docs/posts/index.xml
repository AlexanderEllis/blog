      <description>It was around 4PM a few Fridays ago when I heard that something had gone wrong, and I volunteered (was volunteered?) to help fix it. There was a broken internal configuration that blocked future immediate work for an upcoming launch that same day. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t worked on this particular system, just similar things before, but because I&amp;rsquo;m decent at visualizing and debugging these things, my colleague asked me for help with it.</description>

      <title>Code Review and Criticism</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in software for a few years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come to take it for granted that I am not my work. My work exists in some separate sphere, where it can easily be critiqued, dissected, refactored, or improved by me or anyone else. It&amp;rsquo;s as if it&amp;rsquo;s in a separate pond from my private one, where any ripples don&amp;rsquo;t cross the pebbly barrier to the rest of me. I&amp;rsquo;m still proud of the things I make and still take ownership over code, projects, and problems, but those things are separate from me.</description>

      <description>Looking for an em dash I was recently trying to find an em dash character to use in a piece of writing. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have the shortcut memorized—for future reference, shift+option+minus on Mac—I did a quick search for it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see one on the search results page to copy, so I clicked into the first result: &amp;ldquo;The Punctuation Guide&amp;rdquo;:
From https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html
I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for a good copy and paste, so I selected the em dash character, copied it, and pasted back into my doc.</description>

      <description>One of the best ways to learn and come up with new ideas is to focus intensely on a problem, then let your mind wander. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed doing this when problem solving and learning, and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how weird it is to build trust in your unconscious to do the work for you, especially when it comes to technical work.
Letting your mind focus and letting your mind wander The first recommendation I have for anyone taking a meta look at learning is Barbara Oakley&amp;rsquo;s Learning How To Learn.</description>

      <title>Dark pattern for autoplaying videos: clickjacking pause</title>

      <description>I recently saw a common clickjacking dark pattern when trying to pause a video the other day.
On a Bloomberg news autoplaying video, the sound is initially muted.
Clicking anywhere on the video will unmute it. It would be pretty easy to have an invisible element overlaying the video that listens for a click, and it looks like that&#39;s probably what we have here: What&#39;s interesting is that the control panel (pause, play, scrubbing, etc.</description>

      <description>Junk mail is so interesting at its odd intersection between design, advertising, and psychology.
I usually try to pay attention to the ways that things around me are designed, and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been saving some junk letters that are particularly interesting in their attention-grabbing efforts. Here are a few of the notable envelopes I&amp;rsquo;ve received in the past few months.
 What if we didn&amp;rsquo;t put any information on it and made it look exotic?</description>

      <description>MapReduce Explained Using the Ten Hundred Words People Use Most Often MapReduce is a good way to take a big job that would take a long time on one computer and break it up into smaller jobs that can be done by simple computers.
If you can break down a big job into smaller jobs, you can run the smaller jobs on many simple computers. If you have a lot of simple computers, you can do a lot of the smaller jobs at the same time, and this can make your job go a lot faster.</description>

      <title>Good Design: Double Sided Park Signs</title>

      <description>I often walk my dog around a small reservoir near my apartment. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect distance for tiring a small terrier, and it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful area.
There are a number of signs around the reservoir that tell you to not swim in the water (as it&amp;rsquo;s a backup emergency water supply) and to not walk on the ice when it&amp;rsquo;s frozen over in the winter (as it&amp;rsquo;s very, very cold if you fall in).</description>

      <title>Why does a spray bottle work?</title>

      <description>Exploring a simple machine I took apart a simple spray bottle to see how it kept fluid flowing only in one direction from the reservoir to the nozzle. It does so with simple check valves made of two pieces of plastic, a spring, and a small sphere. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple way to solve a tricky problem.
 A simple spray bottle  One way flow It&amp;rsquo;s often useful to restrict flow to only one direction.</description>

      <title>Letting the User Guide You: Analyzing Store Design</title>

      <description>I enjoy looking at design in everyday life and the balance between how things are designed and how people try to use them.
A store I visited recently had bad customer flow, and the signs were there. There was literally a sign telling customers where to line up for the checkout line. Customers didn&amp;rsquo;t naturally line up there, and an employee was correcting customers who missed the sign. This is bad design.</description>

      <title>Building a Simple Cache Server in Python</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of small toy projects that have the sole purpose of demonstrating a concept. This is a small project that demonstrates how a cache server works.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to balance toy projects with getting exposure to production-level code. While this project has been helpful for understanding the idea, an open source project like [Squid-Cache] (https://github.com/squid-cache/squid) is definitely on my reading list!
At the very simplest level, an HTTP server responds to requests.</description>

      <description>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I&amp;rsquo;ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.
 Jamie Zawinski
Regular Expression Lookbehinds I recently came across an interesting regular expressions use case that led to an interesting look into regular expressions, JavaScript engines, and release versions.
In particular, I was trying to find a certain substring from a string that did not contain a substring preceding it.</description>

      <title>JavaScript: Writing your own Array.reduce</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found that one of the best ways for me to really understand anything is to implement it myself. Between the ECMAScript spec and a few lines of JavaScript, you can build a chunk of knowledge for a very specific area of JavaScript. Doing this often is a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the language, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great exercise in reading the docs, reading code, and creating your own solution.</description>

      <title>typeof null: investigating a classic JavaScript bug</title>
      <link>https://alexanderell.is/posts/typeof-null/</link>

      <guid>https://alexanderell.is/posts/typeof-null/</guid>
      <description>In my last post, I looked into some JavaScript casting and explored why 0 &amp;lt;= null evaluates as true.
For this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to investigate another unexpected behavior in JavaScript: why typeof(null) evaluates as &#39;object&#39;.
This is a well-known bug, and we&amp;rsquo;ll investigate first in the ECMAScript specification followed by a deep dive into an early implementation of JavaScript to see the bug in its natural habitat.
The main idea is that the code assigned each item some bits for use as flags for different types, but null was different.</description>

      <description>The disconnect between &amp;ldquo;what seems like it should happen&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what happens&amp;rdquo; causes you to push doors that are to be pulled, tap ads that load in the place of content, and cast null into 0 by accident in JavaScript.
For more on JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s unintuitive behavior, please watch (or rewatch) wat.
Much of this behavior can be explained by JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s casting. From ECMAScipt: &amp;ldquo;The ECMAScript language implicitly performs automatic type conversion as needed.</description>

Rather than write about what would have ideally happened (the steps of which would look like 1) see bug, 2) know issue, 3) investigate fix, 4) open PR), I wanted to include the entire process, which included some</description>

      <description>Arduinode I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the Arduino Starter Kit projects recently, and I wanted to try a new project that was outside of the pre-made booklet. Working with an offline Arduino (intranet of things?) has let me learn a great deal, and I wanted to see how difficult it would be to connect my Arduino to a simple Node server, which would get me ready to connect it in any future projects.</description>

      <description>I take the MBTA 86 bus as part of my commute in the morning. It runs from Reservoir in Brighton to Sullivan Station in Cambridge, and it stops at Harvard on the way, which is where I get off.
Right after the Eliot street stop, there are two ways for the bus to get underground to the Harvard stop. One way is to go down Bennett St., take a right on University Road, take a right on Mt.</description>

      <description>I worked through the third basic project in the Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book. I like to write about the projects to reinforce my own understanding.
The third project, the &amp;ldquo;Love-O-Meter&amp;rdquo;, creates a simple circuit with a temperature sensor. Using the Analog-to-Digital converter, the Arduino reads in the value coming from the temperature sensor, then lights up a combination of 3 LEDs depending on that value.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what my circuit looked like:</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like:
 This felt different, and it made me look at the experience of opening apps. I started by spending a bus ride home from work opening and closing apps to get a feel for why this wasn&amp;rsquo;t like other apps.
Loading&amp;hellip; A loading screen tells a user that the app or other result is not ready yet.</description>
