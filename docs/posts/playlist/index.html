</ul>
<hr>
<p>There are many musical genres I like, and what I listen to usually depends on my mood at the time. Some days, I want to
listen to Miles Davis, and some days, I want to listen to Slayer.</p>
<p>Some days, I just want to play some normcore Southern rock. The other day, I opened Spotify, went to <em>Free Bird</em>, and
selected &ldquo;Go to radio&rdquo;.  It gave me a playlist, and after playing on shuffle for a few songs, I realized something was
wrong.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="playlist.PNG" alt="A screenshot of a playlist generated by Spotify for Free Bird that includes Harry Chapin and Rage Against The Machine"></p>
<br>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem here? It&rsquo;s a little tag at the top of the playlist, just out of sight in that screenshot: <em>&ldquo;Made for Alex&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Let me start the rest of this complaint with full acknowledgement that I have nearly zero knowledge of
recommendation algorithms. But, to me, this is a problem with personalized recommendations that are over-indexed
on your interests. In particular, when these interests are very disparate; I don&rsquo;t think I would ever
expect a human to create a playlist with nearly polar vibe opposites <em>Cat&rsquo;s in the Cradle</em> and <em>Killing In The Name</em>.
Though they can be loosely connected to the song the playlist was based off of, they clearly don&rsquo;t fit together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably searched for and clicked play on every song in that screenshot, and there&rsquo;s the problem. They have a clear,
explicit signal that these are songs I&rsquo;m likely to like, and there&rsquo;s no signal for interest like an explicit signal
from the user. But, by focusing on this, this means that the source, this <em>Free Bird</em> track, counts less.  Worse still,
it means that it&rsquo;s quick to bleed interests, genres, and vibes, with songs that not only don&rsquo;t fit, but harshly clash.</p>
<p>It could come back to the philosophical question about the goal of a song radio or playlist, but I don&rsquo;t think that even
fully explains it. If you&rsquo;re using it as a way to listen to songs you like, this could work, minus the genre clashing.
If you&rsquo;re using it as a way to discover new, similar music, then it really doesn&rsquo;t work. It leans towards things I
already know about, and by prioritizing those, it&rsquo;s omitting songs I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know. In this case, I wish there
was a separate way to generate these playlists: &ldquo;ignore everything I&rsquo;ve ever told you before and just give me songs that
are similar to this one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In all of my Googling so far, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an easy way to turn this off. I&rsquo;m also not the

this.</p>
<p>Spotify&rsquo;s new <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-12/ever-changing-playlist-daylist-music-for-all-day/">daylist</a> sounds
like it could be what I&rsquo;m looking for, as it&rsquo;s a more &ldquo;match the vibe&rdquo; playlist. For example, it says I&rsquo;ve previously
listened to pop art and soundscape on Sunday afternoons, and it created a playlist with &ldquo;siren, haunting, delicate,
soothing, vocal, and songwriter&rdquo;. All great adjectives, but what if this Sunday I&rsquo;m driving in Boston traffic instead of
doing some delicate vibing?</p>
<p>This is all likely a sign that there are better tools out there for new music discoverability, and I should go discover
them too.</p>
