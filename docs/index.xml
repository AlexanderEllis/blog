      <title>I prefer my biographies in chronological order, thank you very much</title>

      <description>Usually, biographies go through someone&amp;rsquo;s story in roughly chronological order.
OK, that&amp;rsquo;s a little too linear, like a page-a-day journal for your entire life. Realistically, you&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on different parts of the subject&amp;rsquo;s life more than others.
You can imagine that broken up into chapters, too. Maybe our subject&amp;rsquo;s childhood is generally passed over in favor of the more interesting middle-life.
This general flow makes sense, because you can do some fun foreshadowing by mentioning things that happen in the subject&amp;rsquo;s future (orange in the diagram below), and you can remind the reader of things that happened in the subject&amp;rsquo;s past with past references (purple in the diagram below).</description>

      <title>My lizard brain is no match for infinite scroll</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m declaring defeat. Infinite scroll has won.
There is an endless supply of interesting things to consume online, and there are teams and teams of very smart people working very hard to get me to keep watching. One more video means one more metric counter incrementing, one more engagement click, one more step towards growth, ad revenue, product success&amp;hellip;
The danger for me is that I fall in. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to open an app in an automatic movement of muscle memory, filling up an empty moment without conscious thought.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s one of the little things I miss about working in-person with other people.
Writing software can involve so many different tools. Before my current remote working times, one of the ways I picked up on efficient ways to use some of the tools involved was from seeing how coworkers navigated them, especially when they had a lot more practice with them.
A colleague and I would be looking at their screen together, working with a tool that I had an OK understanding of, when they&amp;rsquo;d use a feature or shortcut I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know about.</description>

      <description>Be sure to also check out my other Morse code game, Morse Codle, a daily Morse code Wordle puzzle.
This is a pair of games for playing with Morse Code. Since the games play the signals as sound, I recommend headphones (wired if possible for the latency) and a low volume. Game options are available towards the bottom.
 Unfortunately, JavaScript is needed to run these games. The only JS running on my site is for the games (no tracking, etc) if you want to enable it.</description>

      <description>traceroute is a tool you can use to trace the route of packets from your computer to another computer. It lets you see each step that your packets take along the way.
For example, the following is the result of running traceroute from my computer in Massachusetts to &amp;ldquo;example.com&amp;rdquo;:
You can see that it took 8 hops to get from my computer to the destination IP (93.184.216.34), and you can see the associated timing for three different attempts for each step.</description>

      <description>There are many good things about JavaScript. There are also bad things about JavaScript.
There are many cases of well-intentioned features in JavaScript being used for unhelpful purposes. These features can help support rich web applications with impressive features and capabilities, but they can often be used antagonistically, in the sense that they aren&amp;rsquo;t helpful for the user (like intercepting your clipboard commands). I find these cases interesting, and I wanted to explore a few of these attention-grabbing examples.</description>

      <description>The other day I was reading about the development of personal computers and the desktop GUI, and I was thinking about how comfortable we all have become with the analogy of the &amp;ldquo;desktop&amp;rdquo; for our personal computers. We place files in folders and keep them on our desktops. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of physical action going on.
Humans are very good at understanding spaces, especially when it comes to remembering physical spaces, and it got me thinking about how we commonly visualize code.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: the following document was found in a collection of papers and assignments, apparently dating from late 2020 when the author was stuck inside studying distributed systems. An additional note, written in green and red Crayon on the back of a CVS receipt, was found stapled to the document: &amp;ldquo;it is now winter . this work features only approximate explanations. it favors silliness over accuracy in some sections. it should be taken with a light hearted grain of salt&amp;rdquo; [sic].</description>

      <title>The Strange Path of Accepting How Your Brain Works</title>

      <description>I recently read Turing&amp;rsquo;s Cathedral, a book about the early history of computers, and it largely focused on the life and brilliant times of John von Neumann, who was, to put it simply, a genius. It is both fascinating and disappointing to learn about a brain that works so much better than your own.
Fascinating because the wide spectrum of human ability has led to a brain so capable. That we (in the general, humanity sense of &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;) are able to perform such feats is incredible.</description>

      <description>There are many ways for computers to talk to other computers. A commonly used approach is a Remote Procedure Call, or an RPC. An RPC allows for the abstraction of calling another computer&amp;rsquo;s procedure as if it were a local one with all of the transmission and communication taken care of.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re writing some math program on a single computer and we have some procedure or function that handles checking if a number is prime.</description>

      <description>I recently put together a Raspberry Pi cluster to try out some toy distributed systems projects, and I wanted to start with a basic monitoring program to get my feet wet and work out the following:
 Getting each node running and set up with software Running Go on each machine Deploying code to each machine Nodes listening &amp;amp; responding to RPCs Sending/receiving RPCs between laptop and nodes  As I&amp;rsquo;ve previously mentioned, this isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be production grade, since I would just grab one off the shelf if that was the goal.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been getting more interested in distributed systems, and I wanted to get experience building some of the concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve read about.
My interest lies more on the software and system design side &amp;ndash; more &amp;ldquo;how would we design and build an example of a distributed file system across four computers?&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;how do I make a reliable home server to play media?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; which is why my focus is on playing around with some toy software problems instead of worrying about what a real production hardware setup would look like.</description>

      <description>It was around 4PM a few Fridays ago when I heard that something had gone wrong, and I volunteered (was volunteered?) to help fix it. There was a broken internal configuration that blocked future immediate work for an upcoming launch that same day.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in software for a few years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come to take it for granted that I am not my work. My work exists in some separate sphere, where it can easily be critiqued, dissected, refactored, or improved by me or anyone else. It&amp;rsquo;s as if it&amp;rsquo;s in a separate pond from my private one, where any ripples don&amp;rsquo;t cross the pebbly barrier to the rest of me. I&amp;rsquo;m still proud of the things I make and still take ownership over code, projects, and problems, but those things are separate from me.</description>

      <description>Looking for an em dash I was recently trying to find an em dash character to use in a piece of writing. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have the shortcut memorized—for future reference, shift+option+minus on Mac—I did a quick search for it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see one on the search results page to copy, so I clicked into the first result: &amp;ldquo;The Punctuation Guide&amp;rdquo;:
From https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html
I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for a good copy and paste, so I selected the em dash character, copied it, and pasted back into my doc.</description>

      <description>One of the best ways to learn and come up with new ideas is to focus intensely on a problem, then let your mind wander. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed doing this when problem solving and learning, and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how weird it is to build trust in your unconscious to do the work for you, especially when it comes to technical work.

      <description>I recently saw a common clickjacking dark pattern when trying to pause a video the other day.
On a Bloomberg news autoplaying video, the sound is initially muted.
Clicking anywhere on the video will unmute it. It would be pretty easy to have an invisible element overlaying the video that listens for a click, and it looks like that&#39;s probably what we have here: What&#39;s interesting is that the control panel (pause, play, scrubbing, etc.</description>

      <description>I often walk my dog around a small reservoir near my apartment. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect distance for tiring a small terrier, and it&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful area.
There are a number of signs around the reservoir that tell you to not swim in the water (as it&amp;rsquo;s a backup emergency water supply) and to not walk on the ice when it&amp;rsquo;s frozen over in the winter (as it&amp;rsquo;s very, very cold if you fall in).</description>

      <description>Exploring a simple machine I took apart a simple spray bottle to see how it kept fluid flowing only in one direction from the reservoir to the nozzle. It does so with simple check valves made of two pieces of plastic, a spring, and a small sphere. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple way to solve a tricky problem.

      <description>I enjoy looking at design in everyday life and the balance between how things are designed and how people try to use them.
A store I visited recently had bad customer flow, and the signs were there. There was literally a sign telling customers where to line up for the checkout line. Customers didn&amp;rsquo;t naturally line up there, and an employee was correcting customers who missed the sign. This is bad design.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of small toy projects that have the sole purpose of demonstrating a concept. This is a small project that demonstrates how a cache server works.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to balance toy projects with getting exposure to production-level code. While this project has been helpful for understanding the idea, an open source project like [Squid-Cache] (https://github.com/squid-cache/squid) is definitely on my reading list!
At the very simplest level, an HTTP server responds to requests.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found that one of the best ways for me to really understand anything is to implement it myself. Between the ECMAScript spec and a few lines of JavaScript, you can build a chunk of knowledge for a very specific area of JavaScript. Doing this often is a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the language, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great exercise in reading the docs, reading code, and creating your own solution.</description>

      <title>typeof null: investigating a classic JavaScript bug</title>

      <description>In my last post, I looked into some JavaScript casting and explored why 0 &amp;lt;= null evaluates as true.
For this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to investigate another unexpected behavior in JavaScript: why typeof(null) evaluates as &#39;object&#39;.
This is a well-known bug, and we&amp;rsquo;ll investigate first in the ECMAScript specification followed by a deep dive into an early implementation of JavaScript to see the bug in its natural habitat.
The main idea is that the code assigned each item some bits for use as flags for different types, but null was different.</description>

      <description>The disconnect between &amp;ldquo;what seems like it should happen&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what happens&amp;rdquo; causes you to push doors that are to be pulled, tap ads that load in the place of content, and cast null into 0 by accident in JavaScript.
For more on JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s unintuitive behavior, please watch (or rewatch) wat.
Much of this behavior can be explained by JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s casting. From ECMAScipt: &amp;ldquo;The ECMAScript language implicitly performs automatic type conversion as needed.</description>

      <description>Investigating a bug in Moment.js In this post, I walk through the steps I took while investigating a bug in Moment.js, an open source JavaScript library for dealing with dates and times. Rather than write about what would have ideally happened (the steps of which would look like 1) see bug, 2) know issue, 3) investigate fix, 4) open PR), I wanted to include the entire process, which included some</description>

      <description>Arduinode I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the Arduino Starter Kit projects recently, and I wanted to try a new project that was outside of the pre-made booklet. Working with an offline Arduino (intranet of things?) has let me learn a great deal, and I wanted to see how difficult it would be to connect my Arduino to a simple Node server, which would get me ready to connect it in any future projects.</description>

      <description>I take the MBTA 86 bus as part of my commute in the morning. It runs from Reservoir in Brighton to Sullivan Station in Cambridge, and it stops at Harvard on the way, which is where I get off.
Right after the Eliot street stop, there are two ways for the bus to get underground to the Harvard stop. One way is to go down Bennett St., take a right on University Road, take a right on Mt.</description>

      <title>Temperature Sensing with Arduino</title>

      <description>I worked through the third basic project in the Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book. I like to write about the projects to reinforce my own understanding.
The third project, the &amp;ldquo;Love-O-Meter&amp;rdquo;, creates a simple circuit with a temperature sensor. Using the Analog-to-Digital converter, the Arduino reads in the value coming from the temperature sensor, then lights up a combination of 3 LEDs depending on that value.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what my circuit looked like:</description>

      <description>Shazam&amp;rsquo;s loading screen I was pleasantly surprised by Shazam&amp;rsquo;s iPhone app loading screen, and I took a look into what makes it stand out.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looked like:
 This felt different, and it made me look at the experience of opening apps. I started by spending a bus ride home from work opening and closing apps to get a feel for why this wasn&amp;rsquo;t like other apps.
Loading&amp;hellip; A loading screen tells a user that the app or other result is not ready yet.</description>
