### My name is Alex

That's Karl, my dog. He's anxious, smart, and shy with strangers, but he's a good boy.

I work as a software engineer at [Giant Otter Technologies](http://www.giantotter.com/).  I work mainly towards the frontend but pitch in across the stack.

Academically, I've studied physics and am currently studying computer science.

I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexanderEllis), twitter (infrequently) [@lxmkls](https://twitter.com/lxmkls), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=otras).

I write to teach, practice, and get better at writing.  I also like to help out on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/0101110010110) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8382625/alex).  I've found that writing and teaching are two of the best ways to learn.

I also run [a weekly newsletter for growing horizontally as a developer and learning about new things](https://breadthfirstgrowth.com/).
