### My name is Alex.

I live with my wife and dog in Boston, where I work as a software engineer at Google.  I studied physics, French, and political science in college and more recently studied computer science at Tufts.

I used to work at [Giant Otter Technologies](https://www.giantotter.com).

I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexanderEllis), twitter (infrequently) [@lxmkls](https://twitter.com/lxmkls), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=otras).  I usually post my blog posts to HN for feedback and discussion.

I write to teach, learn, and get better at writing.  I also like to help out on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/0101110010110) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8382625/alex).  I've found that writing and teaching are two of the best ways to learn.  Explaining things is hard, but I enjoy it!

Blog powered by [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io/) and runs on GitHub pages (keeping it very simple). Theme is a modified version of Cactus Plus by [nodejh](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus).

The opinions stated here are my own, not those of my company.
