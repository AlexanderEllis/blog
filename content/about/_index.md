### My name is Alex.

I live with my wife and dog in the Boston area where I work as a software engineer at Google.  I studied physics and French during my undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis and more recently computer science at Tufts. I love to write and teach, and I've found that explaining things is the best way to learn.

I used to work at [Giant Otter Technologies](https://www.giantotter.com), a very small AI startup that got acquired by [Drift](https://www.drift.com/).

I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexanderEllis), twitter (infrequently) [@lxmkls](https://twitter.com/lxmkls), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=otras).

This blog is powered by [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io/) and runs on GitHub pages ([repo](https://github.com/AlexanderEllis/blog)). Theme is a modified version of Cactus Plus by [nodejh](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus).
