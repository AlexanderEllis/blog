### My name is Alex.

I live with my wife and dog in the Boston area where I work remotely as a software engineer at Netflix.  I studied physics and French during my undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis, and I more recently [studied computer science part-time at Tufts while working](/posts/mscs). I love to write and teach, and I've found that explaining things is the best way to learn.

I used to work at Google, and before that I worked at [Giant Otter Technologies](https://www.giantotter.com), a very small AI startup that got acquired by [Drift](https://www.drift.com/).
