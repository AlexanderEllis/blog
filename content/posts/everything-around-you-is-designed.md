Quotes I want to use


Steve Jobs quote:
"Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it. "

(Caveat about people definitely being smarter than you)

Peter Norvig quote:
"I think a lot of programming is being able to keep as much as you can inside your head, but that only goes so far, at least in my head. Then you have to rely on other people to have the right abstractions so that you can use what they have. I started thinking about it in terms of, 'How is this likely done?' rather than, 'I know how this was done because I did it.'"
