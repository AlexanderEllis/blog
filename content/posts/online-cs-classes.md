CS classes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and I've taken one in nearly every shape and size.

In this post I'll be breaking down some of the differences between the various styles I've encountered, and I'll be dividing up the classes I've taken into three categories: online classes (free), online classes (paid), and in-person (paid).

### Caveats

I'll be taking a subjective look at differences in motivation, which requires that we look at my mileage, which will most likely vary from yours. Comparing prices and expensiveness is also very subjective: what does "expensive" mean to me, and what does it mean to the reader? I'll include details beyond "expensive" to help anchor.

This is also not intended to be a *How To* guide for taking classes. Since there are so many variables, it's difficult to give a single source of advice. Feel free to reach out if you want biased-but-specific advice, but you won't find any in the rest of this post.

### Background

I studied physics for my undergrad but managed to not take any CS classes during my college years (definitely not recommended if you want to work with computers). I've since taken a large handful of CS classes. I started with some free online classes, took some in-person classes at Tufts as part of their post-baccalaureate program, and later took an online class through Oregon State. I took all of these part-time while working full-time.

### Comparing and contrasting

To compare these, I'm going to look at the following categories:

**Price**: what was the cost like?
<br>
**Experience**: what was the experience like? What was it like asking for help, and was I able to learn effectively?
<br>
**Motivation**: how motivated was I when taking the class? How easy was it to complete the class after starting? How did the style of the class affect my motivation?

Here's a quick **TL;DR**:

| Format        | Price          | Experience | Motivation       |
|---------------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| Online (free) | Free           | Good       | Less motivated   |
| Online (paid) | Less expensive | Good       | Middle motivated |
| In-person     | Most expensive | Great      | Very motivated   |

### Online (free)

I've given a serious effort to taking a handful of free MOOCs. Note that this doesn't include classes I've barely started then abandoned, which is quite a few more.

- Harvard's CS50 [TODO: add link] (completed)
- MIT's Intro to Programming via EdX [TODO: add link] (completed)
- MIT's Intro to Algorithms via OCW [TODO: add link] (started seriously but abandoned)
- Stanford's Lagunitas Networking class [TODO: add link] (started seriously but abandoned)

#### Price

There's no better price than free. I completed these courses when first getting into programming, well before I had the disposable income from a programming day job, and the lack of tuition meant it was absolutely open to me.

#### Experience

The structured format of CS50 and Intro to Programming were tremendous. They both gave the full experience with quizzes and graded programming assignments. These classes were well suited for learning by doing, where your projects allowed you to apply what you learned. Production quality for CS50 is ridiculously high, and it remains my first recommendation for anyone interested in learning more about computers.

The network for these classes is also very solid. For CS50 in particular, an active subreddit [TODO: add link] meant that there were always people willing to help you debug your pointers. This helped mimic the environment of working in a lab with peers to ask for help, which is invaluable for learning.

#### Motivation

As anyone who has tried and abandoned a MOOC knows, it's very easy to fool yourself into thinking the motivation come easily. The classes are exciting when you first start, and the first lecture goes down easy. I fall into the trap of extrapolating the rate at which I'm getting through lectures: "At this rate I'll be done in a month!" Except the material is hard, I had a long day at work, I didn't make time for the lecture yesterday, and...

As much as I'd love to pretend I can easily get through a MOOC just for the sake of learning (), it's hard and I've failed. So much for building an online persona! #stayMotivated https://xkcd.com/874/

For the classes I was able to complete, I had a very clear goal: transition out of customer service phone calls and into a proper programming job. For the ones I didn't complete, there wasn't as much of a clear goal.

I found that the structure and material of the class also affected my ability to stay motivated and finish the class. Getting feedback is an important part of learning, and the classes with the best structure were the ones I was able to stick with best. The two I completed had autograded assignments, projects, and quizzes, which gave you a good idea for how you were progressing.  The two classes I started but didn't finish were less well suited to the online autograding, and I found that when taking a similar class with a different style (algorithms class in person), I was able to do much better.

One thing I found was that the loose deadline structure meant that it was easy to spread out a single class. I think CS50 took me more than a single semester, but I was able to get through it. This probably allowed the incomplete classes to slip as well; there's no deadline on this assignment, so I can push it off until the elusive "tomorrow" until I never finish it.

### Online (paid)

After taking classes at Tufts, I took an online class through Oregon State University  [TODO: add link] to gain some familiarity with assembly and lower-level programming:

- Oregon State's Computer Architecture and Assembly Language [TODO: add link]

#### Price

The OSU class I took was expensive, but not nearly as much as the in-person classes (spoiler alert). Clocking in at roughly $1,250, this is far from trivial. I'm lucky to be in the position where I'm able to cover it, but it's definitely a barrier to entry.

#### Experience

The online class had a strong structure and support system, which was great for getting it done. Having graded assignments was key for forcing me to get in there with the nitty gritty details. I probably would have skipped a few less-interesting lectures if there wasn't an exam on the material.

#### Motivation

Motivation was a little easier for this class. I had a better feeling of "it would be silly to pay real money and not try", which helped me sit down and study.

The real deadlines also helped direct my work and keep me focused. When there's a quiz due next Sunday, it's much easier to take an hour to study. When I know I can't take the quiz after Sunday, I wasn't able to procrastinate as much.

### In-person

I took five classes at Tufts as part of their post-baccalaurate program [TODO: add link]. I took one class a semester part-time while working full time. Here are the classes I took:

- Data Structures
- Discrete Math
- Algorithms
- Artificial Intelligence
- Theory of Computation

#### Price

The biggest downside to the in-person classes I've taken is the price. It's plain expensive to take the classes at Tufts.

When I started, tuition for part time students was roughly $4,000 per class. During my post-bacc there it changed to $1,718 per credit, with 5-credit classes costing a total of $8,590 for a single class. This was actually why I didn't take the 5-credit assembly class there; great as it may have been, the price tag was brutal.

#### Experience

The in-person experience was fantastic. There's something about being there in person that is great for my style of learning. Being able to ask questions halfway through a lecture was great for confirming or solidifying my knowledge, and working with other students gave me the chance to help teach and be taught. Growing with others is a great way to grow.

#### Motivation

I found it very easy to stay motivated for in-person classes. I'm not sure if it was because of the hefty price tag (more below) or knowing better the person who would be grading my assignments, but it was helpful.

I also found that it was also easier to have a healthier separation between school and the rest of my life. There was a clearly defined time for class, and although I did plenty of work outside of it, there was less of the nagging feeling of having to figure out the times that you would watch the lectures for the week.

Like the online classes with the structured assignments, I found that the feedback was absolutely key for learning. For the classes where it's harder to auto-grade the assignments (algorithm runtime proofs, for example), having exams and assignments forced practice what we learned in class.

### Patterns and lessons

On the surface, it looks like there's a linear relationship between price and motivation. For me, putting money down helps for the accountability. Although I'm not proving it to anyone, feeling like I've made an investment helps motivate me. I think it's that feeling of "I've spent so much money that giving anything less than my best would feel foolish." Sunk cost fallacy? Probably. One way to help motivate myself? I think so.

That being said, I don't think that the motivation increase for the in-person classes is due solely to money. As I mentioned above, building relationships and having structure really helped.

I've also been very lucky to be in a position where I'm working as a software engineer while taking these classes, which has allowed me to cover tuition without taking out loans. Without my day-job paycheck, I don't think the in-person classes or even the online class would have been feasible without loans. This is part of the reason that I hesitate to give advice beyond just telling my own story to giving

One thing I haven't discussed is *value*. How do you decide the value of a class? This is so subjective, and it could be a discussion on its own. _My subjective answer_ is a combination: partly what you've learned, partly the people you've met, partly the experience, and partly the credentials you've gained, then subtract the cost.

### Lessons on lessons

In-person classes seem to be the best for me, but the biggest downside is the price. I'm very fortunate to be in the position where my employer is willing to cover a great deal of the tuition, and I'll be continuing classes at Tufts.

These online classes though, they're top notch. The fact that CS50 exists is incredible, and having it free and online is a tremendous resource for anyone looking to get into computer science.
