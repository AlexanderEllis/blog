I dabble with DNS for work, and I'm frequently checking if CNAMEs are properly
configured. CNAMEs are Canonical NAMEs, kind of like nicknames, that indicate
that one domain name is a nickname for another domain name. For example, you
probably encounter CNAMEs that map from the classic `www` subdomain:

```none
www.example.com CNAME example.com
```

This entry indicates that `example.com` is the Canonical NAME for
`www.example.com`. When you go to `www.example.com`, your DNS resolver sees this
entry and looks up the right side instead, `example.com`, which then (hopefully)
resolves to the actual destination. This is pretty neat, and it can be handy for
doing all sorts of interesting things with subdomain.

If you aren't familiar with CNAMEs or DNS, I'd highly, highly recommend
[Julia Evans' _How DNS Works!_ Zine](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/26/new-zine--how-dns-works-/).

I was thinking about CNAMEs the other day and a silly question popped into my
head: if CNAMEs are used to define domain names that are the canonical names for
other domain names, what if we defined another CNAME that just pointed back to
the first? What if there was a cycle?

### TL;DR nothing terribly exciting happens. They thought about this back in 1993.

We can see what this looks like with a quick `dig`:

```none
blog: $ dig a.alexanderell.is

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> a.alexanderell.is
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:

```

Well that's not very exciting. There was a `SERVFAIL` on the query.

What does the full query look like starting from the root servers?

(Feel free to skip to the [end of the output](#break-down), where I walk through it query by
query).

The `dig` output can gnarly, but let's break this down.
`dig` is recursively asking _"Where do I find this domain?"_, starting with the
root servers and asking the DNS server in the answer. You can imagine it walking
through a big tree of DNS servers as they get more and more specific.

You can see the first request in the first `QUESTION SECTION`: `. IN NS`, or
_"I'm looking for any domain. Who are the root servers?"_. This query did fine,
and it returned the root servers and where to find them.

```none
;; Got answer:

... where to find other root servers
```

<br>

The next question was to ask the root servers about this domain. We can see it
asked the server with IP `202.12.27.33`, which corresponds to
`m.root-servers.net` above. We asked it how to find `a.alexanderell.is`, and it
pointed us to the `.is` TLD name servers (and a Swedish name server, see the
`.se`). Again we can see that there was no error, which makes sense.

```none

;; Query time: 90 msec
;; SERVER: 202.12.27.33#53(202.12.27.33)
```

<br>

Next up, we can see the query to one of the `.is` TLD name servers,
`2001:67c:6c:56::10`, which corresponds to `ht-tldsecondary01.isnic.is`. It
responded with the DigitalOcean name servers, because I originally set up my
Icelandic hostname with them to point at a droplet, though I now just use
DigitalOcean for DNS things, though I probably don't need them any more.
Regardless, again we see no error.

```none

;; SERVER: 2001:67c:6c:56::10#53(2001:67c:6c:56::10)

```

<br>

Finally, we can see the query to the DigitalOcean name server for this silly
setup. We got nothing back, other than a final result that there was a
`SERVFAIL`, which, as you may have guessed, means there was a failure on the
server.

```none
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 28117

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 46
```

I think it's pretty likely that the DigitalOcean name server started to look
this up and quickly realized they were dealing with me, a fool, who pointed a
CNAME to a CNAME that pointed back to the first CNAME. This seems like it could
be a pretty basic cycle check, and it makes sense that they're guarding against
such cases.

### What if we went outside of DigitalOcean?

Maybe the issue is that we're giving the DigitalOcean name server too much
freedom to squash our silly attempts. What if we split the CNAMEs across name
servers? I just happened to have a Google domain for a side project I'll get
around to someday, and it's pretty easy to point them at each other.

**Google Domains DNS setup:**

**DigitalOcean DNS setup:**

![Screenshot of my DigitalOcean DNS config with a.alexanderell.is pointing to a.reviewscheduler.com](do-dns.png)


This is some seriously silly stuff right here. Giving this a shot, we can see
that spreading these CNAMEs across two name servers made a difference, and we
can now see both CNAME entries from a single dig:

```none
blog: $ dig a.alexanderell.is

```

If you look at the traces (exercise left to the reader), you can see that
there's a little more going on under the hood, in particular what looks like
proactive lookup ahead of time on Google's side. Importantly though, these
servers find that the end result is another CNAME pointing back to the original,
and they go no further.

If we now try to curl one of these hosts, the DNS resolution times out after a
while, as it's now probably trying these CNAMEs back to back, looping as it
makes futile attempts to resolve. Sorry, curl.

```none
blog: $ curl -v a.alexanderell.is
... 30 seconds later
* Could not resolve host: a.alexanderell.is
* Closing connection 0
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: a.alexanderell.is
```


### What does the DNS spec say?

If we go back to 1993, [RFC 1536](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1536)
explored some of these issues:

```none
2. Recursion Bugs

   When a server receives a client request, it first looks up its zone
   data and the cache to check if the query can be answered. If the
   answer is unavailable in either place, the server seeks names of
   servers that are more likely to have the information, in its cache or
   zone data. It then does one of two things. If the client desires the
   server to recurse and the server architecture allows recursion, the
   server chains this request to these known servers closest to the
   queried name. If the client doesn't seek recursion or if the server
   cannot handle recursion, it returns the list of name servers to the
   client assuming the client knows what to do with these records.

   The client queries this new list of name servers to get either the
   answer, or names of another set of name servers to query. This
   process repeats until the client is satisfied. Servers might also go
   through this chaining process if the server returns a CNAME record
   for the queried name. Some servers reprocess this name to try and get
   the desired record type.

   However, in certain cases, this chain of events may not be good. For
   example, a broken or malicious name server might list itself as one
   of the name servers to query again. The unsuspecting client resends
   the same query to the same server.

   In another situation, more difficult to detect, a set of servers
   might form a loop wherein A refers to B and B refers to A. This loop
   might involve more than two servers.
```

That's us!

```none
FIXES:

      a. Set an upper limit on the number of referral links and CNAME
         links you are willing to chase.

         Note that this is not guaranteed to break only recursion loops.
         It could, in a rare case, prune off a very long search path,
         prematurely.  We know, however, with high probability, that if
         the number of links cross a certain metric (two times the depth
         of the DNS tree), it is a recursion problem.

      b. Watch out for self-referring servers. Avoid them whenever
         possible.

      c. Make sure you never pass off an authority NS record with your
         own name on it!

      d. Fix clients to accept iterative answers from servers not built
         to provide recursion. Such clients should either be happy with
         the non-authoritative answer or be willing to chase the
         referral links themselves.
```

No surprises here — these all make sense as ways to defend. This does bring up
another interesting question though: what's the longest valid DNS chain we can
make? Another exercise left to the reader.

### What other things are out there?

I'm no expert on DNS servers (I'm more of an "application layer well after DNS"
guy), but after a quick search, I found an interesting article about
[DNS loops and potential attack vectors](https://www.sidnlabs.nl/en/news-and-blogs/tsuname-dns-loops-are-a-well-known-problem-but-arent-properly-addressed-by-current-rfcs),
where they found from a real-world example that NS record cycles can be
used to magnify queries to the authoritative servers. In their words:

> Last May, we publicly disclosed tsuNAME, a DNS vulnerability that could be
> exploited to mount DDoS attacks, where resolvers, clients and/or forwarders
> send endless queries to authoritative DNS servers. Although earlier RFCs have
> documented the existence of DNS name loops, none of them have fully addressed
> the problem. To fix that, we have proposed a new IETF draft to the DNS
> Operations Working Group (DNSOP WG).

From [their technical report on tsuNAME](https://tsuname.io/tech_report.pdf):

> On 2020-02-01, two domains (DomainA and DomainB) under .nz had their NS
> records misconfigured to be cyclically dependent. DomainANS records were
> pointed to ns[1,2].DomainB.nz, while DomainB NS records pointed to
> ns[1,2].DomainA.nz. This configuration error led to a 50% surge in query
> volume at .nz authoritative servers (Figure 1) . The .nz operators manually
> fixed this misconfiguration on 2020-02-17, after which the queries to return
> to normal levels

From the _Emulating TSUNAME_ section, they describe recreating the issue with
their own authoritative servers. They used probes to send ~18,000 DNS queries to
their first hop resolvers, and those requests were _magnified to ~8,000,000
queries to the authoritative servers_. Recommend reading through the technical
report if you're curious — it's pretty interesting stuff.

Glad I stopped at CNAMEs.
