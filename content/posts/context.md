One of the challenges I've encountered when working remotely is the difficulty
of establishing different contexts for my mind. I find that having different
physical spaces allows me to better switch mental modes, as if walking through
the door.

All of my remote work has been from various apartments in the Boston area, where
my work-office has also doubled as my living room, my dining room, or my second
bedroom and home office.

Easily the best improvement (other than life opening back up as things become
safer with the pandemic) was getting a second bedroom and moving my working
space from a shared living space, where my work setup was never really out of
sight, to the second bedroom, where there was a separate space and, importantly,
a door to shut.

When my local office opened back up, it was really nice to spend a little time
there. I enjoyed seeing my colleagues in person, and it was really nice to carve
out some dedicated time for heads-down work.
