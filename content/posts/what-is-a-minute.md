What's in a minute? It can be sixty long seconds, or it can be just a blink of the eye.

### Easy ways to slow time down

If you're trying to slow time down, see how long a minute feels for any of the following:

- If you're able to, hold a plank for 60 seconds
- Read the [*Elementary Rules of Usage* section from *The Elements of Style*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37134/37134-h/37134-h.htm#Page_7)
- If you're able to, sprint at full speed for 60 seconds
- After asking a question to a group and hearing no response, wait for 60 seconds before offering the answer
- Try to hold your breath for 60 seconds
