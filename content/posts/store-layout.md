Design is in everything we see.

You don't notice good design.

You do notice bad design.

Sometimes design is hard.

I was at a store recently with bad design.  There were three factors that made it clear.  First, there was a sign telling customers where to line up for the checkout line.  Second, customers didn't naturally line up there.  Third, an employee was telling customers where to line up.

Here's a quick sketch of the layout:

                                      ||         #

```

A curved counter extended from one wall down towards the back of the store.  Two cash registers were on the bottom-right section of the curve.  There was a display of small checkout-trinkets at B and calligraphy materials on the right wall at B.

Where would you line up?  Where would you want customers to line up?

Customers would naturally approach the cash registers from where they had been, and we can assume that they will usually be coming from the rest of the store where the majority of the supplies are.  They can spend time waiting in line looking at the checkout-trinkets ("I _should_ buy a mini rubrick's cube and a pocket magnifying glass for $3!"), and as they move through the line to the cash register, they can turn to the right and follow the wall to the exit.
